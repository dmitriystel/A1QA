Code review 23.12.2022
4th comment:
the base class must be abstract, so you can't create an instance of it
fixed: BasePage class is abstract

5th comment:
The driver should not be passed as a parameter to a method or constructor.
If you need a driver, call it through DriverSingleton.getInstance()
fixed: driver called through DriverSingleton.getInstance()
*/
public abstract class BasePage {
    protected WebDriver driver;
    protected BasePage() {
        driver = DriverSingleton.getInstance();
    }
}
